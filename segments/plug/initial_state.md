# Plug Initial State

## What does this mean?

An initial state for your plugin means that there are set values, described by your [Models](models.md).
This initial state will be the state that your plugin will hold in each node upon starting.

For example, If you are building a plugin that stores user balances, you may want some initial users to exist within the node. By setting the initial state those users can have a starting balance.

Initial States are useful for testing locally, but your project may also require that a state exists to begin with.

## How do I set an Initial State?

The initial state is described in your main `config.yaml` file.

The structure should be:

```yaml
plug:
  #Other values here
  initial_state:
    #Initial State values here
```

If we go by the example of a plugin that stores user balance, we may have a `BalanceModel` model for our plugin. Our initial_state would like like so:

``` yaml
plug:
  initial_state:
    example.BalanceModel:
      ABC: #public key indexing model
        balance: 100 #This is the initial balance for this "fake user"
      DEF:
        balance: 200
```

If we wanted to store users and a list of other user public keys, say, following list for the user, we would have a `FollowingModel` that stores a `following` list inside:

``` yaml
plug:
  initial_state:
    example.FollowingModel:
      ABC: #public key of user indexing the model
        following: #Model inner list
          - "123" #list entry
          - "xyz" #list entry
```

Each use of a `-` indented below your Models inner list name describes a new entry within that list in the initial state.
