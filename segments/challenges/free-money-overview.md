# Free Money Challenge Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to get a better understanding of how new Transforms are created in Plug, and how to handle working with them on the client side. Once completed, the Free Money Challenge will allow you to do several things. Using a command line interface, you will be able to:

- Create new Users.
- Query the balance of a specific User.
- Transfer money between two Users.
- Give some free money to a specific User, of whatever denomination you chose.

This challenge is a good starting point for a variety of reasons. It covers a lot of functionality that will be common across a wide variety of blockchain applications, and is easily extendable into further challenges or projects.

After completing the Free Money Challenge, you should feel confident in your understanding of the following areas:

- What [Models](../plug/models.md) are, and how they work.
- The process of creating a new [Transform](../plug/transforms.md) to manipulate the state of the blockchain.
- How to write client side code to manually POST Transform events to the server.
- The basics of the Plug client_api, and how to get it POSTing your Transform events for you.
