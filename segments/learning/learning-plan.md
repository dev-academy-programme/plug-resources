# Make a Learning Plan

The most important part of learning well is to have great learning habits, the best way to get great habits is to have a great plan.

## Book in learning sessions

Go to your calendar book in your learning time for the next week. Make sure you give yourself enough breaks and if possible block out time when you have the most energy. You will learn better when your brain is fresh, but sometimes you have to squeeze learning time around other commitments. 

It's much better to have multiple learning sessions throughout the week than to binge learn all on one day. It's also good to allocate enough time to your learning sessions so that you can get onto a roll while having enough breaks to stay fresh. Find the balance that works for you.

## Make a "questions" list

Choose a digital or physical list, but make sure you have it handy whenever you are learning. As you come across a concept that you don't understand add it to your list of questions. Frequently review the list and whenever you understand something, cross it off your list.

The amount of questions you cross of your list is a great measure of your progress, it also makes it easier for you to get the most value when you get the help of someone who is further ahead than you are with the material.

## Make a list of learning objectives

As you get more familiar with the material and you start to work through your questions list you should gain clarity on the big things you need to learn which will move you forward. Make another list called learning objectives and start to prioritise learning tasks which will help you meet them. 

It is a combination of learning objectives and learning tasks booked in to your calendar which create a fully formed learning plan. 

## Keep your eye on the prize

When you're learning your objective is to grow your skills and knowledge. Completing a challenge flawlessly or understanding everything in a piece of content is a waste of time. So too is pushing your way through a challenge and getting it to work, and then forgetting everything straight away.

Remember, it's not about what you tick off or get done, it's about what you learn.
