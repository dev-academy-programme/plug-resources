### Read

Read through the code you have just written. Sometimes we can get pretty ahead of ourselves and think we understand something just because we solved it, which is often not the case.

Usually every exercise repo will contain a `solution` branch. You can either checkout this branch within your terminal or view the code on the Github repository.

When you are looking at your solution, compare it to our solution to see where we have done things differently, whether in structure or semantic code. You may learn a thing or two. You may even have sometime to teach us!

### Revise

Take notes! A lot of the code you have written for this exercise will be reused in a similar form in the next exercise(s), so be sure to note down what you have learned so you can come back to it later.

Review the learning objectives for the challenge and the conceptual material covered before it. Take note of concepts or code that is still mysterious to you so that have a list of topics to dive deeper into.

### Redo

Checkout the `master` branch of the exercise and make a new branch. Aim to work through and solve the exercise again without looking at either the `solution` branch, or your original branch. Be honest with yourself and reflect on what challenges you ran into, which concepts aren't sticking?

Note the tricky points down and go back to the [Read](#read) and [Revise](#revise) steps with these challenges in mind to really cement your learning.

### Recreate

Could you build the same exercise from scratch? 

Try starting from a blank repository and give yourself the challenge of following the same steps with the same end goal as the exercise, but do it without the hand-holding of our boilerplate.

### Reach

Have you completed all of the stretch goals in the challenge overview? Can you think of any features that you could add?

Think of how the app could be more broadly applicable to a variety of users. Think in the terms of User Stores. (i.e. As User type `X`, I would like to do `Y` so that I may `Z`). Once you have a user story, it is easier to design the feature that will enable that use case.

The possibilities are endless!

Creating your own stretch goals is a great way to test your ingenuity and understanding when it comes to new technology.
