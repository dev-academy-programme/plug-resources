# I have finished, what next?

We design our exercises to accomodate students of all backgrounds. This means some experienced developers may finish the task at hand within the day, where others may want to continue their progress at another time.

The great thing about all of this however, is that noone ever finishes an exercise as there is always potential to squeeze more learning out of every challenge or resource.

If you find yourself finishing the directed steps and are looking for something more to further your learning, we have created a very complex formula for optimal learning that is just the thing you are needing.

We call it...

## The 5 R's (arrrrr...)

* [Read](#read)
* [Revise](#revise)
* [Redo](#redo)
* [Recreate](#recreate)
* [Reach](#reach)

### Read

Read through the code you have just written. Sometimes we can get pretty ahead of ourselves and think we understand something just because we solved it, which is often not the case.

When you are looking at your solution, compare it to our solution to see where we have done things differently, whether in structure or semantic code. You may learn a thing or two. You may even have sometime to teach us!

Usually every exercise repo will contain a `solution` branch. You can either checkout this branch within your terminal or view the code on the Github repository.

### Revise

Take notes! A lot of the code you have written for this exercise will be reused in a similar form in the next exercise(s), so be sure to note down what you have learned so you can come back to it later.

Take notes from the [Resources](../segments) that we have linked in this guide, and our `solution` branch for the exercise.

Take note of concepts or code that is still mysterious to you so that you may ask a Teacher or do some "internet research" later on.

### Redo

Shampoo companies will always tell you to "Rinse and Repeat". We are telling you the same thing. I promise that we are telling you this as a habit that will benefit your learing, and NOT as a conspiracy to sell twice as much shampoo.

Checkout the `master` branch of the exercise and make a new branch. Aim to work through and solve the exercise again without looking at either the `solution` branch, or your original branch. Be honest with yourself and reflect on what challenges you ran into, which concepts aren't sticking?

Notes these tricky points down and go back to the [Read](#read) and [Revise](#revise) with these challenges in mind to really cement your learning.

### Recreate

Could you build the same exercise from scratch? Do you want to be able to? Well, that's great to hear!

Using the Free Money task as an example:

Have a look at our resources for [Setting Up Plug](../segments/plug/setup.md) and [Cookie Cutter](../segments/plug/cookie-cutter.md).

Try using Cookie Cutter to build the scaffold of a new Plugin and have a look around. This is what we used to build the skeleton of the exercise, so a lot of the structure and names should be very familiar to you.

Give yourself the challenge of following the same steps with the same end goal as the exercise, but do it without the hand-holding of our boilerplate.

### Reach

Have you completed all of the stretch goals in the `README`? Can you think of any features that you could add?

Think of how the app could be more broadly applicable to a variety of users. Think in the terms of User Stores. (i.e. As Demographic/User type `X`, I would like to do `Y` so that I may `Z`). Once you have a user story, it is easier to design the feature that will enable that use case.

The possibilites are endless!

Creating your own stretch goals is a great way to test your inginuinity and understanding when it comes to this tech.
The potential of crypto is vast and yet unfufilled. Start thinking creatively about what the possibilites of this technology are, it'll benefit you in the long run, we promise.
