# Plug prep material 

This guide is to help you learn enough about Plug that you can use it to start building your own dapp. It has been created specifically for the Blockworks hackathon.

Note that Plug is hot off the shelf technology so you won't be able to google when you get stuck on Plug specific material. If you need to figure out what's going on try

1. Read through the Plug docs in the plug-libs repo
1. Look at the solution branch for the challenge
1. Read through the Plug source code
1. Ask for help in the slack group
