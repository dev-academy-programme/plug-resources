# An Introduction to Plug

1. [Work through the quickstart section of the docs](/plug-intro.md#quickstart)
1. [Work through the balance tutorial](/plug-intro.md#balance-tutorial)
1. [Complete Freemoney challenge](/plug-intro.md#freemoney-challenge)
1. [Review the Freemoney sample solution](/plug-intro.md#freemoney-solution)
1. [Decide what to do next](/plug-intro.md#decide-what-to-do-next)

## Quickstart

Open up the core plug documentation in `plug-libs/docs/plug/_build/html/index.html` and work your way through the Quickstart section. As you progress, try to build up a good set of questions you are curious about on your questions list.

## Balance Tutorial

Next tackle the balance tutorial which is under the tutorials section of the core documentation. Work your way through the "Building your first Plugin" and "Deploying your first Plugin". See if you can add more questions to your question list, and perhaps cross off some of your initial ones. 

## Freemoney challenge
Read through the [Freemoney Challenge overview](/segments/challenges/free-money-overview.md) and then make a fork of the repo at https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/plug-free-money-challenge. Remember to frequently commit and push your code as you work through the challenge.

Refer to the plug-api docs `plug-libs/docs/plug_api/build/html/index.html` for information on how the python client library works and pay attention to how we are testing both the server and client side code.

## Freemoney solution
Read through the solution branch on the Freemoney repo and have a look at our walk through of the [sample solution](/segments/challenges/free-money-solution.md). What makes sense and what do you need to dig deeper into?

## Decide what to do next
Remember the [5 Rs](/segments/learning/5-rs.md) - see if you can write down some learning objectives, and then make a plan to achieve them.
