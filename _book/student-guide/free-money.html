<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>Before starting this exercise you should familiarise yourself with the core concepts of the <a href="../segments/python">Python programming language</a>.
If you have never coded in Python before, we recommend working your way through all of the linked concepts. Python is a very developer friendly language and if coming from other languages such as Javascript or Ruby, you should be able to pick it up in no time!</p>
<p>The tricker Python code you will want to understand are <a href="../segments/python/classes.html">Classes in Python</a>.
Be sure to read through the external links provided if you have not dealt with Python Classes before, as you will be using these extensively throughout this and other exercises.</p>
<h2 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this exercise is designed around Blockchain technology. Blockchain tech is awesome and has plenty of unfufilled potential, but it can also come across as a very large, sometimes scary, piece of work.</p>
<p>We don&apos;t want it to be scary for you, so we recommend reading up on our resources about <a href="../segments/crypto/blockchain.html">Blockchain</a>. These resources can be quite reading intensive and mostly describe concepts rather than code, so you should skim read the material and bookmark anything that sticks out to you as interesting/confusing to come back to later.</p>
<p>This first exercise is designed to teach you these concepts as you work, so don&apos;t stress if it doesn&apos;t all make perfect sense immediately!</p>
<h2 id="plug">Plug</h2>
<p>You may know what Python is. You may know how Crypto/Blockchain tech works. But how much do you know about Plug?</p>
<p>We&apos;d hope you don&apos;t know too much, because we really want to be the ones to teach you all about it!</p>
<p>The challenges in this exercise are centered around how to program a Plugin for Plug, so you should definitely focus you learning on the <a href="../segments/plug">resources for Plug here</a> as the examples and descriptions here will be vital for solving this challenge.</p>
<p>If you have the time and interest, we encourage you to read and try out everything. However, if you learn by doing and want to get stuck into things, at least give <a href="../segments/plug/models.html">Plug Models</a> and <a href="../segments/plug/models.html">Plug Transforms</a> a look.</p>
<p>Transforms and Models are the center of the Plug tech for this exercise and will be a cornerstone of future exercises too.</p>
<h2 id="im-done-now-what">I&apos;m done, now what?</h2>
<h3 id="read">Read</h3>
<p>Read through the code you have just written. Sometimes we can get pretty ahead of ourselves and think we understand something just because we solved it, which is often not the case.</p>
<p>When you are looking at your solution, compare it to <a href="https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/plug-intro/tree/staging" target="_blank">Our Solution Branch</a> to see where we have done things differently, whether in structure or semantic code. You may learn a thing or two. You may even have sometime to teach us!</p>
<h3 id="revise">Revise</h3>
<p>Take notes! A lot of the code you have written for this exercise will be reused in a similar form in the next exercise(s), so be sure to note down what you have learned so you can come back to it later.</p>
<p>Take notes from the <a href="../segments">Resources</a> that we have linked in this guide, and <a href="https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/plug-intro/tree/staging" target="_blank">Our Solution Branch</a>.</p>
<p>Take note of concepts or code that is still mysterious to you so that you may ask a Teacher or do some &quot;internet research&quot; later on.</p>
<h3 id="redo">Redo</h3>
<p>Shampoo companies will always tell you to &quot;Rinse and Repeat&quot;. We are telling you the same thing. I promise that we are telling you this as a habit that will benefit your learing, and NOT as a conspiracy to sell twice as much shampoo.</p>
<p>Checkout the <code>master</code> branch of the Free Money exercise and make a new branch. Aim to work through and solve the exercise again without looking at either the <code>solution</code> branch, or your original branch. Be honest with yourself and reflect on what challenges you ran into, which concepts aren&apos;t sticking?</p>
<p>Notes these tricky points down and go back to the <a href="#read">Read</a> and <a href="#revise">Revise</a> with these challenges in mind to really cement your learning.</p>
<h3 id="recreate">Recreate</h3>
<p>Could you build the same exercise from scratch? Do you want to be able to? Well, that&apos;s great to hear!</p>
<p>Have a look at our resources for <a href="../segments/plug/setup.html">Setting Up Plug</a> and <a href="../segments/plug/cookie-cutter.html">Cookie Cutter</a>.</p>
<p>Try using Cookie Cutter to build the scaffold of a new Plugin and have a look around. This is what we used to build the skeleton of the Free Money exercise, so a lot of the structure and names should be very familiar to you.</p>
<p>Give yourself the challenge of following the same steps with the same end goal as the Free Money exercise, but do it without the hand-holding of our boilerplate.</p>
<p>We expect this to be quite a challenge given how new all of this will be for you, so this may be a task to come back to at a later time. If you are willing to give it a go however, be reflective and honest with yourself, and remember that the focus on your learning, not perfect regurgiation!</p>
<h3 id="reach">Reach</h3>
<p>Have you completed all of the stretch goals in the <code>README</code> for Free Money? Can you think of any features that you could add the the Plugin?</p>
<p>What if a user received less Free Money everytime they requests some?
What if there was a limit to how much Free Money a user could claim?
What if there was a limit to how much Free Money could be given away to users, say, (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-a-limited-amount-of-bitcoin-available" target="_blank">21 Million</a>)?</p>
<p>The possibilites are endless!</p>
<p>Creating your own stretch goals is a great way to test your inginuinity and understanding when it comes to this tech.
Like we said earlier, the potential of crypto is vast and yet unfufilled. Start thinking creatively about what the possibilites of this technology are, it&apos;ll benefit you in the long run, we promise.</p>

<p>If you like the format of the above recommendations for extending your learning, we have a more <a href="what-next.html">generalised resource here</a> that you should bookmark and apply to all future exercises.</p>
<h2 id="next-exercise">Next Exercise</h2>
<p>Congratulations on your progress with the Free Money exercise. Keep in mind that you can always come back here to test your retention of knowledge or your growth in understanding at a later date, so be sure not to forget about this page.</p>
<p>The next exercise for you to work through is the <a href="cryptokiwis">Crypto Kiwis</a>. Feel free to have a look at the guide anytime for pre-exercise reading, but you will want to wait for your Teacher to present the exercise before you begin to work on it.</p>
